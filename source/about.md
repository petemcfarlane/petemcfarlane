# About

This blog is a place for me to share insights about my work as a software engineer, things I find interesting or challenging, things that may be of use to other people and things that may be of use to myself in the future. It is also intended as a learning platform for myself to try out different technologies, so it may have a tendancy to change every once in a while.
