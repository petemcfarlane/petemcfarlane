Docker has made it possible and easy to run specific software or applications in a presice, recreatable and sharableÂ environment.

For example, lets see how to run our test suite from a specifc version of PHP.

Firstly install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) - the missing package manager for OS X.

Then install Docker `$ brew install docker` (or download from the [Docker toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox))

Once Docker is installed you can run any image from the docker hub. We're interested in the [official PHP image](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/).

You can run a container with `$ docker run php`

But we want to supply some more arguments though:

`$ docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/app -w /app php:7 php test.php`

`-i` (interactive) keep STDIN open if not attached

`-t` allocate a psudeo TTY

`--rm` automatically remove the container when it exits (good for space saving!)

`-v "$PWD":/app` mount the current working directory (on your host) to the /app directory (on the docker 
container).

`-w /app` when the container launches, set the working directory to /app (in the container)

`php:7` use the php image, version 7

`php test.php` the command `php` will execute the file `test.php` (providing this exists in your local dir)
